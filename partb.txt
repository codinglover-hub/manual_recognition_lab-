Scale

Problem: The object in the image is larger or smaller than the template.

Why it fails: Template matching compares pixel values directly, so a template at one scale won’t match an object at a different scale.

Illumination

Problem: Lighting changes (too bright, too dark, shadows).

Why it fails: Pixel intensity values differ under varying lighting, so even if the object is the same, the template won’t match.

Occlusion

Problem: Part of the object is blocked by another object.

Why it fails: Template matching needs the whole pattern to match. Missing parts break the match, resulting in a failed detection.

Deformation

Problem: The object is stretched, rotated, or bent.

Why it fails: Template matching assumes a rigid shape. Deformations change the object’s geometry, so pixel-by-pixel comparison fails.

Background clutter

Problem: The background has similar textures or patterns as the object.

Why it fails: Template matching cannot distinguish object from background if both look similar, producing false matches.

Viewpoint

Problem: The object is viewed from a different angle.

Why it fails: Template matching assumes the object has the same orientation as the template. Different viewpoints change the shape in the image, breaking the match.
