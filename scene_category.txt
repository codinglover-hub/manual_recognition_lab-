Scene Category: INDOOR
Reasoning :
The image shows sofa, pillows, lamps, artwork, and furniture, which are strong indoor cues.

There is artificial lighting from lamps.

The presence of decor items and framed artwork indicates a living room interior.

Even though windows show outside, the dominant visual scene is inside the room.
